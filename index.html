            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> “A legendary name in South Indian comfort food, this super-popular eatery has had Bengaluru eating out of its hands since 1924.” </h4>

              “Integrity is the backbone of MTR. It’s the core reason for its survival over the decades. Whether it’s food or conduct in business, emphasis is on ethics and fair play.”
              The most iconic restaurant in the southern Indian city of Bangalore is the 92-year-old MTR, or the Mavalli Tiffin Room. It's also the place that many say serves the "world's best dosa", writes the BBC's Geeta Pandey.</div>
